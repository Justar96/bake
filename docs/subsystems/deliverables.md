# Deliverables

English | [中文](deliverables.zh.md)

The `present` tool lets an agent declare files for delivery and writes the declaration as a log-only Session event. The [group map](../../packages/deliverables/README.md) and [tool-present README](../../packages/deliverables/tool-present/README.md) own current configuration and behavior.

Source: [`packages/deliverables/tool-present/src/types.ts`](../../packages/deliverables/tool-present/src/types.ts)

## `PresentedFile` — one declared delivery

```ts type-equiv
/** A declared filesystem file whose current contents remain at its source path. */
interface PresentedFile {
  /** Original absolute path or path relative to the Session working directory. */
  path: string
  /** Optional description supplied by the model. */
  description?: string
}
```

## Durable delivery event

`tool-present` merges `deliverables/presented: { turn; callId; files: PresentedFile[] }` into `SessionEventMap` and appends it after a successful `present` call. The declaration does not enter model context.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.workspaceChanges` — `WorkspaceChanges`

Serves the summaries and file comparisons the recorder keeps for live Sessions.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The summary announced by one `workspace/changes` event.
 * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.
 * @param seq - the event's sequence number.
 * @returns the summary, or undefined once its Session was disposed or when this Host never recorded it.
 */
summary(sessionId: SessionId, seq: number): WorkspaceChangesSummary | undefined

/**
 * Compare one listed file's contents at turn start and turn end.
 * @param sessionId - the Session that appended the event.
 * @param seq - the event's sequence number.
 * @param index - the file's index in the summary's `files`.
 * @param signal - cancels the reads.
 * @returns the comparison, or undefined once its Session was disposed, when this Host never recorded it, or when no file has that index.
 * @throws when a snapshot read fails for a live Session.
 */
diff(sessionId: SessionId, seq: number, index: number, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<WorkspaceFileDiff | undefined>
