# web/ — web access capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `web/` packages let models search the public web and fetch HTTP(S) pages through `web_search` and `web_fetch`. Search providers currently include Exa and DeepSeek; the HTTP fetch provider handles page retrieval. Availability and limits depend on the configured provider.

## Packages

Six packages play the web roles; the subsystem reference owns the exhaustive vocabulary and contracts.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`web/`](web/README.md) | Search/fetch service: search and fetch URLs through interchangeable backends, one selection and error policy | `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-exa/`](web-search-exa/README.md) | Searches the web through Exa | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-search-deepseek/`](web-search-deepseek/README.md) | Searches the web through DeepSeek native search | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`web-fetch-http/`](web-fetch-http/README.md) | Fetches public HTTP(S) pages anonymously | registers on `ctx.web` |
| [`tool-web/`](tool-web/README.md) | Exposes `web_search` and `web_fetch` to the model | registers on `ctx.tools` |
