## Packages

Eight packages play the host roles; each package README owns its contract and configuration.

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`webserver/`](webserver/README.md) | Browser HTTP server: named routes, upgrades, index taps, and the fallback seat | `ctx.webServer` |
| [`plugin-inventory/`](plugin-inventory/README.md) | Read-only projection of current Loader entries | Remote `pluginInventory/list` |

- [HTTP server subsystem](../../docs/subsystems/web-server.md) — the webserver's routes, matching order, and config.
- [Workspace subsystem](../../docs/subsystems/workspace.md) — the workspace records the directory picker feeds.
- [Web config-tree boot and transport layering](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-24-web-config-tree-boot-and-transport-layering.md) — ownership of the Web transport layers.
